# Medical-screening-app

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a web application to facilitate the use of a portable screening device for medical purposes. The app allows Operators to enter patient details, capture face images, and access diagnosis reports, while Doctors can view patients, crop images, and submit diagnosis reports.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with Bootstrap (or Material-UI/Tailwind for styling)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose (local MongoDB or MongoDB Atlas)
- **Image and File Uploads**: Multer for handling image and report file uploads
- **Deployment**: (Optional) Heroku for backend, Netlify for frontend

## System Architecture
The system is divided into three layers:
1. **Frontend**: A React.js application with forms for data input and features for image capture and report download.
2. **Backend**: RESTful APIs built with Node.js and Express, connected to MongoDB for data storage.
3. **Database**: MongoDB stores patient information, images, and diagnosis reports.

## User Roles and Actions
### Operator:
- Add new patients (name, age, gender, contact).
- Capture patient face images and upload them to the server.
- View diagnosis reports from doctors.

### Doctor:
- View patient details (awaiting and diagnosed).
- Crop patient images for better diagnosis.
- Submit diagnosis reports (in PDF format).

## Frontend Components
### Patient Registration Form:
- A form to capture patient details.
- Uses Bootstrap/Material-UI components for UI.

### Image Capture:
- Webcam integration for capturing face images.
- Uses react-webcam and uploads images to the server via Multer.

## Backend Implementation
### API Endpoints:
- **POST /api/patients/add**: Add a new patient to the MongoDB database.
- **POST /api/upload/image**: Upload patient images, storing them in the server's uploads folder and saving the URL in MongoDB.
- **POST /api/reports/submit**: Upload a diagnosis report and save the file URL and comments in MongoDB.

### Multer for File Handling:
- **Image Files**: Stored in the uploads folder, with URLs saved in the corresponding patient record in MongoDB.
- **Report Files**: Stored in the reports folder, with URLs and comments saved to MongoDB.

### Database Schema (MongoDB)
The Patient schema is defined using Mongoose:
```javascript
const PatientSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  age: { type: Number, required: true },
  gender: { type: String, required: true },
  contact: { type: String, required: true },
  status: { type: String, default: 'awaiting_diagnosis' },
  imageUrl: { type: String, default: '' }, // Stores image URL
  report_url: { type: String, default: '' }, // Stores report URL
  comments: { type: String, default: '' } // Stores diagnosis comments
});
```

### API Example for Image Upload
Here's an example of the image upload route (upload.js):
```javascript
router.post('/image', upload.single('image'), async (req, res) => {
  const { patientId } = req.body;
  const imageUrl = `/uploads/${req.file.filename}`;
  try {
    const updatedPatient = await Patient.findByIdAndUpdate(patientId, { imageUrl });
    res.json({ imageUrl });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).send('Server error');
  }
});
```

## Testing Instructions
### Patient Registration:
1. Go to the patient registration form on the Operator UI.
2. Submit the form and verify the patient record in MongoDB Compass.

### Image Upload:
1. Use the webcam capture feature to capture and upload a patient image.
2. Check if the image URL is saved in the patient record in MongoDB.

### Report Submission:
1. Submit a report using the Doctor's dashboard.
2. Verify that the report URL and comments are stored in MongoDB.

## Conclusion
This project provides a complete web-based system for managing patient information, capturing images, and uploading diagnosis reports. With a scalable architecture, secure data handling, and responsive design, it enables smooth interaction between operators and doctors for medical diagnosis.
